I remember in high school talking to a Swedish girl, who told me about high school graduation in Sweden. Everyone rents a big bus and drives around sweden partying. I was shocked and asked her where the police was. And she replied they were everywhere...to ensure and protect the people partying from hurting themselves!!
This blew my mind. Never once until she told me that story had I considered that the police's role not to stop people from doing what they want but was to protect them while they were.
This reaction was followed by me thinking I had just been thinking the wrong way my whole life and I should think more like her. 
It was only on reflecting that I realized, its not necessary a fault of mine...its more systemic than that. I was raised growing up in a country where my parents always told me to watch out and be extra careful around the police cause their job was to try and find a reason to catch us. 
I am beyond privileged to have parents and a family who could protect me, and live in a community that is less racially oppressive than the US...I can not even fully comprehend the effects of growing up in a black community where their understanding and interpretation of the role of the police comes not just from a warning from elders but strong and petrifiynig experiences in childhood. 
I want to think of and discuss situations in which the police are called on today, but probably shouldn't be. What are they? and who should come to aid instead?
I want to keep in mind the risk police offers are taking...if they do show up to a expectedly peaceful scene unarmed and it turns violent (cos guns are still legal in the US, smh) ...what do we expect police or other officers to do?",2020-06-10 07:08:43

Clearly he spent the time to bring together phenomenal people. My understanding is that you have to do things that dont scale early on...I wonder how you do that when you're goal is to build a system to product organs at scale. I wonder if its possible to produce a MVP high scale output system for organs such that it produces a lot of organs but the system itself need not scale.
I point this out because of the importance of speed and iteration from YC and your previous post. I also wonder if speed is as valuable when you dont need to verify market need. Cos well, its pretty obvious here. The only risk is technical not business. I never thought of it that way. Doing things that dont scale is only important when you want to verify that you're solving a valuable problem. If you know the problem is huge and untouched, its worth it to go all out I guess.

What’s interesting to me about Kamen’s approach is that it’s almost a VC model applied to scientific research.

4402,2,5812,"Biggest Takeaways
1. Measure cohorts and notice and observe engagement chages over time for these cohorts. 
Cohort being people that joined in the same week or so.Most apps decrease over time or reach a cap. If you have network effects, you should be able to see engagement go up over time as network effects add value to the platform

2. DAU/ MAU -> if its 60%, it means a user is on average using the platform 18 days out of a month. The average means this is a skewed metric. Being driven by the extreme users. 
DAU/MAU doesnt make sense if you dont expect daily usage. 
Also, its important to understand how things affect DAU/MAU -> Notifications will bring back the inactive non-daily users and not power users as much, so it'll increase your MAU and not really your DAU, so DAU/MAU may actually go down

3. Engagement vs Retention - They have overlap but think of this example. Weather apps have really low engagement but high retention. You check it for 10 seconds by you come back regularly

4. Frequency, Engagement, Monetization - You want to dominate in at least one of these

5. MAU = New users - Churn + Resurrected - as you scale its hard to increase MAU (or keeo  growth rate high) by trying to go more and more users and engagement/retention become critical 

6. L28 / L7 - How many users use your platform for 1 day a month vs 2 days a month vs ...28 days a month. Why?",2020-07-11 11:28:16

I perceived them all as completely independent, unrelated identities. So this threw some light on it. 
Also, I have a few black friends but ZERO close black friends. Which is insane, so I have very little understanding of how each of these communities perceives each other
Also, I realize I use ""black"" and refer to African American's and nothing else which is an issue. 
This gave me a lot to think about, and perhaps a reminder to put myself in more diverse situations

5992,2,12426,"I feel like culture is formed in different ways in exclusive and inclusive communities. 
In exclusive communities, where the people currently in the group influence who get in (companies, frats, selective student org etc) - culture is largely top down cos recruiting inherently tries to look for culture match, which makes culture persist across generations of the group. This cycle leads to culture being trickled down from the founders.

On the other hand, in inclusive communities where the existing members have little influence over who gets to be members, members get to be themselves and you end up with cultural democracy 

Another things this post made me ask was -> what makes art, music etc a part of culture? The answer I came up with was that ""anything that allows social commentary on the current climate"" constitutes culture. It makes so much sense that art from different eras and during different tragedies would look different across time but similar to other works from the same time.

-> What is productivity?
1. Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum speed on everything

-> Measuring it?
2. Measure Goals -> Have people and teams set their goals for a period of time and measure whether they were able to hit it

3. Measure Quality -> find ways to measure quality of work. Less work of higher quality is generally more valuable than lots of low quality work

4. Track task completion -> Use our sprint board and ask people to plug their tasks s to complete into each goal and keep track of them

-> How to improve it?
6. Better work environment -> Set designated areas for deep/silent work and separate areas for collaborative work.

7. Flexible working hours -> Set core collaboration hours for everyone but encourage flexible working hours outside those

9. Optimize meetings -> Set days with no meetings. An agenda needs to be sent out or a meeting cannot happen

10. Set clear expectations  and deadlines -> Performance measuring goals. Efforts required. Pro-activity and focus. Professionalism and disciplines.... etc. Everything needs to be crystal clear

11. Encourage self care and time off - You have to be an example and be loud about this to make other feel okay doing this. 

12. Coach employees on their priorities - Show people how to timebox, and discuss their schedule with them to prioritize whats most valuable to the company. Make this part of your 1-1s

13. Share time managements skills - Show people the Pomodoro technique. Show people to block off specific calendar times when they need to work 

14. Avoid interruptions - Ask people to add talking points to meeting agendas instead of sending messages

15. Boost moral by celebrating accomplishments - Shoutout people, Send positive notes/thank people, Ask what motivates them and do more of that, send positive feedback",2020-11-01 04:38:22

1. Gender analysis of laws! Had no idea that was a thing. Makes a lot of sense
2. It is valuable to quantify unpaid work. Because if it wasn't being done by the people who are doing it for free, it would be done for money by someone else
4. Changing plowing to reflect the true usage of roads. Because planners did not think about women, because they weren't women. 
5. ""Its hard to remember that women exist"". Holy shit, I never want to make decisions that affect people without running it by a woman ever again
6. Default man: When people assume a human, they assume a cis man.
7. Ensure all data gathering collects equal amounts of data from men and women. 
8. The fact a designer is a woman is not good enough, because the woman might be picturing a default man as her user
9. The median man != the median human
10. Woah. All car crash dummies are men, which means cars are fundamentally not designed for women (from the seat built to many more nuanced things) -> Which leads to more women being  injured and dying from a car crash
11. The width of a piano key was designed with male fingers in mind

6212,2,14802,"The ultimate goal is to minimize deaths.
If vaccinating vulnerable populations is going to cause fewer deaths than let's do that. But if vaccinating super spreaders reduces deaths more so, than lets do that. 
I disagree with the sentiment behind your comment - people who are intentionally causing harm should be considered less deserving. If this were the case, the justice system would be justified in doing many harmful things to criminals. But the best justice systems are those that acknowledge the goal is to create global peace and the way to do is objectively by making criminals less likely to commit crime, and the way to do it is by making criminals comfortable, training them in empathy and putting them in a path that prevents the original need for crime. 

You could extend that thinking here. Super spreaders are spreaders because they are trying to meet some deep rooted need. We need to find ways to meet their needs without putting others at risk. Inherently shaming super spreaders is a temporary technique unlikely to work for long periods of time.

6462,2,17142,"My biggest takeaway from this is that I should be releasing tons of products, each with the absolute minimal feature set - instead of trying to spend a long time solving one problem. There is ofcourse the time needed to understand the user and what the required feature set is - but it sounds a bit absurd that something that doesn't work with the minimal GREAT feature set won't work. 

There are a few notes
1. The features that determine the great have to be 100x what the market provides. For Wander, that is better discussion than you can have elsewhere - we don't do that yet. Also, it took us way too long to realize that this  was the core feature

2. Starting with the wrong user. The one case I would spend more time with a product beyond 6 months to get traction, is if there's some reason we might have had the right set of features but perhaps focused on the wrong initial customer.",2020-11-21 22:03:49

1. Have people look at each others calendars, so that everyone is aligned on what is the most important thing to be spending their time on                                             
2. You want to be aggressively poking holes in your own ideas
3. What dimensions of an idea do you change depending on who you're talking to? Level of detail of the how. Example use case(s). The amount of time you spend on the Why/What/How. What else?                                    
4. I honestly have very little clue about how to architect systems that are truly robus  to network outages and server crashes. Need to get the basic gist of this
5. A ""host"" city's culture will seep into your office. For example, people in offices in israel will be very blunt. But people in offices in Canada will tend to be much nicer
6. Surround youself with people who are extremely adaptable in chaotic situations. Impose chaotic situations to find out who those are
7. I have stopped spending my time learning specific new skills intentionally. Is this a problem? Do I need to get back into it, or just keep learning skills as the need arises? Is learning something complex and time consuming a skill worth practising even when not needed imminently?
8. Explain people you work with the example of how a jazz band works - because that's how the ideal team should work. Harmonous or intentionally dissonant but with no central authority telling everyone what to do
9. I didn;t understand the section on Spotify's organisational design and what they were saying about Incentive structures? Any help with that?
10. Tobi hates song shees. Are PRD's the  song sheet of tech? or are they different because they don't specific the technical details of how something shoould be done but the song sheet does?
11. ""I feel so good when I do something, and it just doesn't work; especially if I get the feedback about why it didn't work""
12. ""a lot of success in life is how good you are at making long term choices"". What short term choices am I making right now that are not optimal in the long run?
13. ""Personally, I have found it really, really useful to be able to reason about a relationship without getting egos involved too much. I can have a conversation with someone saying, “Hey, you made a commitment to ship this thing, and you did. That's awesome. That's a super big charge on the trust battery, but you’re actually late for every meeting. Even though that's relatively minor—like it decreases 0.1% on your battery—you should fix that.”""
14. Get everyone around you to treat trust as non binary but rather a spectrum (a trust battery)
15.  ""An hour spent with a coach has a 10x, 50x, 100x potential return on time spent"" ->  Do I need someone like this in my life on a weekly basis?
16. When Tobi visits silicon valley, what is he doing to charge his 'thinking big batteries? And how can I do that when I travel to a place?
17. Study wikipedia and Linux, and how they work. 
18. 50% of what anyone does is important; we just don't know what 50% it is.
19. Tobi has done his days of long hours, but at his current point in life - Family matters more",2020-12-22 10:13:41

The idea that students can provide something that the school can sell is very interesting. I'm guessing the school is selling the plastic bags to a recycling company or to plastic brick manufacturers to support the cost.
I think the beauty of this lies in taking long term costs and making them short term. All of a sudden the cost of burning your plastic which was a long term hard to realize cost became the price of school which you can experience on a short term basis. Awesome

Great Share. I'm probably going to both ask this question and think about the answer for myself. What's the most difficult think I have worked on... and how I solved the problem?
I can't think of any extremely difficult techinical problem I have worked on. But the most significant thing I have worked on so far, has been Wander.
We were and still are struggling to maintain constant insight into whats working and what's not and to move at the needed pace. To solve for this - recently we introdoced two mechanisms. We made all our Feature documents the hub of all our work. Everyone has to keep them updated at all timed. You can look there once and you instantly know where every single feature in the company is and who's responsible. We also introduced a goal tracker to help everyone say exactly what they're going to work on each day - this keeps them more accountable.

The next major challenge I am going to face is: How do you scale an early social media product. Tbh, I don't have the answer yet. We will come up with our plan this week, try it out and I'll let you know how it goes",2021-01-27 03:04:26

First, signing up for a newsletter will be trivial given the fact Twitter already has your email address.
Second, Twitter can surface interesting newsletters within the Twitter app; it can also create a reader experience on a separate tab.
Third, Twitter can leverage the fact that (almost) all readers are logged in to transparently manage free previews, trials, etc.
Fourth, Twitter can promote your newsletter to all of your followers over time without you needing to shamelessly (or shamefully) beg them to subscribe.
Fifth, Twitter can seamlessly incorporate newsletters into promoted tweets, and charge against future revenue — which, of course, it can perfectly measure.""",2021-01-28 15:56:44

So we once had to interrupt people with phone calls, and then we were like, “Oh, you know, why don’t we just send text message or email”? Why do we need to that person to answer us right at this moment? Then it was streaming media. Why do you have to be home at 7:00 PM on a Thursday to watch whatever TV show, what if you could just do that on demand? You go category-by-category and I think the Internet was like, okay, let’s go asynchronous, and we’re going to generate a ton of value.</p><p>But I’m starting to sense that there was something lost in everything going asynchronous, and that we’ll start to see media companies experiment a little bit with trying to force some level of synchronicity again, just to help us regain that feeling of community. Sometimes when you’re on Twitter when something crazy is happening, or there’s a sporting event and everybody’s watching it live, you do have that feeling that I used to have when I was a kid, when ABC would have it’s <i>Sunday night Movie of the Week</i>, and I would ask my dad if I could stay up and watch. It would be like some James Bond movie that my dad and I had watched like ten times already, but it was different watching it at that moment because I knew like 30 million Americans were also at home watching that exact moment with me. And in a period where media companies, especially if you think about sports and everything, which is all at a standstill right now, are looking at, okay, what do we do with this old content? I think some of it will be creative experimentation with generating this synchronous sense of community again.""</p>",2021-09-20 18:41:46

I don't blame you for calling Zuckerberg a fool – Facebook as a platform is a mess and it's easy to blame his incentives structure and decision to reward certain metrics and not others as foolish. However, after hearing him speak quite a bit about why he's making this pivot, I've actually started to become more of a fan. I think he's admitting his mistake with Facebook, to some degree, and is focusing the company on what's next as opposed to what's clearly not working now. I think with the level of talent and tech at Meta, he knows that they can pioneer something much more net positive.

Email spam isn’t solved, but it’s a lot better now, because 3rd parties knew that the email protocol was decentralized, so they could build businesses on top of it without worrying about the rules of the game changing later on.”</li></ul>",2022-07-25 18:35:09

It's the same thesis as that in Stephen Wolfram's <a href=""https://amzn.to/3b7TWjy"">A New Kind of Science</a>.<br>The key implication for AWS from the book was about how to design the first AWS primitives. Jeff urged us to include only what was necessary and nothing more. If you were designing a storage service, like S3, you'd need functions like get, write, delete, but you wouldn't want to layer in things that weren't part of storage, like security.
